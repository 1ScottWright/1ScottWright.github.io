                          This project was originally a Kaggle competition, but our class took the data from the challenge
                          and used it as the basis of a group project.  We were assigned to teams of three people and tasked with
                          coming up recommendations for the City of Chicago with regards to mosquito / disease management.

                          One of the key themes for this challenge was to work together and to use GitHub to coordinate our work.  This
                          was the first time anyone in our group had worked with branching in git, pushing changes, and having a repository
                          owner accepting / pulling changes into the master repository.
                          <br><br>
                          There were also a number of new concepts that we could test out, particularly wiht spaital data.  My team team tried
                          some clustering routines to treat data from mosquito traps that were close to each other in a similar fashion.  We also
                          used the georgraphic data to map West Nile hotspots around the city.

                          The Kaggle website is still availble, so we did get the opportunity to make predictions and have them scored.  It was
                          a bit different from Project 2, however, since the class wasn't running a private site.  We did, however, get some
                          satisfaction from seeing our scoring metric, area under the ROC curve, improve as our analysis imporved.
