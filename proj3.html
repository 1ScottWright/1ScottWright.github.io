                          As we passed the half-way mark of the twelve weeks of intesive data science learning,
                          the challenge the instructors laid out before us was to find at least two subreddits to scrape.
                          Use those posts to perform natural language processing to anlyze the data.
                          <br><br>
                          We were given a bit of latitude to explore a question of our own choosing within the context of the
                          project and to determine what type of analysis each us wanted to do.  Some in the class chose sentiment
                          analysis using the Vadar analysis package.  I decided to take a more playful turn with my project.
                          <br><br>
                          I created a classification problem for myself.  I decided to compare the posts from a royalty-themed
                          subreddit versus posts from a RuPaul Drag Race subreddit.  Using Pipelines and Gridsearch, over a variety of
                          decision trees and classification models, I was able to train a model that was over 90% accurate in discerning
                          whether a particular post came from one subreddit or the other.
                          <br><br>
                          The exercise was a good way to use a variety of NLP techniques - including CountVectorizer, TFIDF, and a few ways of
                          lemmetizing individual words.
