                        <p>This project was a fun one!  It definitely brought out my compeitive spirit.  The team
                          at General Assembly arranged a private Kaggle compeition for all of the data science courses in the US.
                          It spanned ten classes from coast to coast.  We were just learning some of Python's capabilities with respect
                          to machine learning and were limited to regression techniques -- it was out of bounds to use methods (such as Random Forests)
                          that we had not yet learned in class.
                          <br><br>
                          My key take away from this exercise was a reminder to periodically pull myself out of the details, the modeling, the data,
                          and remind myself of the bigger picture:  what am I trying to do, what is working, and <b>where</b> is it not working.
                          <br><br>
                          Another positive from the project was that I intuitively started down a path that we would learn about in the future --
                          combining results from two different models that produce better predictions than each of the models separately.  I plotted
                          a few graphs that showed my training data fitting too high with one model and two low with the other.  So, I averaged the results
                          of both.
                        <br><br>
                         At the end of the contest, I was in 11th place out of 200.  Not bad, but not my goal....#1 or bust!
