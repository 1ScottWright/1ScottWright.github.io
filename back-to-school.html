                                  I have taken the first steps in my journey to radically change my life.  Actually, just those first few steps have accomplished the radical change part.  But over the course of the next few months, I expect a few more changes that register the same or higher on my life’s version of the Richter scale.

                                  A week ago, I was the CFO of a reinsurance company with billions in annual revenue, an actuary who had climbed the corporate ladder and truly enjoyed my job, life, and responsibilities.
                                  <br><br>
                                  But for years, I had the feeling that there was more that I wanted to do, but unsure what that was or where to start.  After serious soul searching, “sharing Saturday” discussions with my partner, and endless hours of researching options, I decided to make a major life change.  Data science was calling and I was ready to answer, but I wanted to do it right.  Get my hands very dirty.  Build up a body of knowledge from the ground up.  It was time to go back to school.
                                  <br><br>
                                  After my first week, I’m feeling very good about my decision to take the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly in Atlanta.  The first morning included those “first day at school” jitters that I haven’t experience for over 25 years.  The bedlam of getting 100 students in six cities situated, coding along with an instructor, and learning new software programs was exactly as I had imagined: fear of falling behind, panic as I tried to soak up all the newness as quickly as I could, and relying on the support provided by the local instructor.  Git?  Jupyter Notebooks? Terminal commands?  All new five days ago.  Tentative friends as of today.
                                  <br><br>
                                  I survived those first few hours and started to hit a stride, now only a few days later.  I’m sure their are rough seas ahead once the topics get more intense and the pace quickens, but I’ve already started forming a support network with my fellow Atlanta based students and our local instructor / guide.
