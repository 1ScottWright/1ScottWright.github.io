                        <p class="mb-30">The purpose of this class project was to get comfortable using Python
                        to perform data analysis.  We learned to use Pandas dataframes to read in csv files, manipulate data,
                        and eventually come up with inferences obtained from the data.  The scenario we were asked to
                        analyze was a recommendation to the College Board, administrators of the SAT, on how to increase
                        participation in the exam.  In addition to the Python code for analysis, we presented our results to
                        the class.
