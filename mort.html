                        <p>
                         In this project, I explored the relationship between certain macro-economic variables and the change in US population mortality.
                         <br><br>
                         Using an ARIMA model with exogenous variables, I was able to forecast the life expectancy of males and females using training data from 1960 -1995 and testing data from 1996 - 2015.  The overall conclusion is that there are some variables that are useful in modeling life expectancy for both males and females (such as the weight and alcohol consumption).  There are other factors that are only useful in measuring male life expectancy (income inequality and the change in miliatry spending per year).
